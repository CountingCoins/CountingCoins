- 👋 Hi, I’m @CountingCoins
- 👀 I’m interested in helping in anyone in anyway that I can 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as possible about crypto & the future of crypto 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Dogecoin 

I am a research enthusiast! I have the odd need to research anything & everything that 
I don't fully understand...from basic everyday life matters to in-depth studies 
of scientific,medical,legal,etc...
In cases like the in-depth government studies, If I don't understand what I'm reading,
I stop, research it & then go back to where I left off. I'm a vat of useless knowledge! 
I'm not sure how much storage I have remaining😂
